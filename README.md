# gemGAT
This is the official repo of gemGAT: **Cross-tissue Graph Attention Networks for Semi-supervised Gene Expression Prediction**. gemGAT aims to enhance gene expression prediction across different tissues.

## Dataset
gemGAT requires the following dataset to train the model:

1. Gene expression in the source tissue.

2. Gene-gene network (e.g., co-expression network) in both source and the target tissue.

A sample dataset can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1z_qdChCJM3GdjBTQfQWKjuK7oyF3oXir?usp=drive_link).
